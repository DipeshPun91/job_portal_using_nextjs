Explanation of Each Variable:

    NEXTAUTH_URL: The URL where your app is hosted. For development, this is typically http://localhost:3000.
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET: A random string used to secure your authentication sessions. You can generate one using openssl rand -base64 32.
    MONGO_URL: The connection string to your MongoDB Atlas cluster. You can find this in your MongoDB Atlas dashboard.
    OTP_SECRET: A secret string used for generating OTP (One-Time Password) tokens.
    EMAIL_USER: The email address (Gmail) used to send OTPs.
    EMAIL_PASS: Gmail requires an app-specific password for sending emails via SMTP. You can create one in your Google Account settings under "Security".
    SMTP_SERVICE: The email provider service (gmail in this case).
    SMTP_PORT: The SMTP port (587 for Gmail, 465 for secure SSL connections).
    SMTP_SECURE: Whether the connection should be secure (false for TLS, true for SSL).
    NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY: The public site key for Google reCAPTCHA, which you get when setting up reCAPTCHA for your domain.
    RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY: The secret key for validating Google reCAPTCHA tokens.

More Detailed Step to setup MongoDB and Google reCAPTCHA.

1.  MONGO_URL: Connection String to MongoDB Atlas Cluster
    MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-hosted database service. Here's how you can create your cluster and get the connection string for the MONGO_URL:

    Steps to Get MongoDB Atlas Connection String:

    A. Sign up for MongoDB Atlas:
    Go to MongoDB Atlas and sign up for an account if you don't have one already.
    After signing in, click Start Free or Create Cluster.

    B. Create a Cluster:
    Once logged in, click Create a New Cluster.
    Select the cloud provider and region. You can choose the free tier for a simple project (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
    Click Create Cluster (this may take a few minutes to provision).

    C. Create a MongoDB User:
    Once the cluster is created, you'll need to create a MongoDB user.
    Go to the Database Access tab on the left.
    Click Add New Database User and enter the username and password. Make sure to copy the password somewhere secure.

    D. Allow Network Access (IP Whitelisting):
    Go to Network Access and click Add IP Address.
    You can either allow access from anywhere by adding 0.0.0.0/0 (not recommended for production) or specify your IP address.

    E. Get the Connection String:
    Go to Clusters and click Connect.
    Choose Connect your application.
    Choose your driver (Node.js) and version (e.g., 4.0 or later).
    Copy the connection string provided (e.g., mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority).

    F. Modify the Connection String:
    Replace <username> and <password> with the MongoDB user credentials you created.
    Replace myFirstDatabase with the name of your database (you can name it something like job-portal).

    G. Add to .env.local:
    MONGO_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

2.  EMAIL_PASS: Gmail App-Specific Password for Sending Emails via SMTP
    Google has security measures in place for using your Gmail account with third-party apps or websites. Youâ€™ll need to create an app-specific password for your Gmail account to send emails through the SMTP server.

    Steps to Create a Gmail App-Specific Password:

    A. Enable 2-Step Verification:
    Go to your Google Account.
    On the left-hand sidebar, click Security.
    Under Signing in to Google, make sure that 2-Step Verification is turned on.
    If it's not enabled, click 2-Step Verification and follow the steps to enable it.

    B. Generate an App-Specific Password:
    After enabling 2-Step Verification, go back to the Security tab.
    Scroll down to Signing in to Google and click App Passwords. If you can't find App Password then search for App Password on search field.
    You might be asked to sign in again for security reasons.
    In the Select app dropdown, choose Mail.
    In the Select device dropdown, choose Other (Custom name) and give it a name like "Job Portal Website SMTP".
    Click Generate.
    You will get a 16-character app password. Copy this password (you wonâ€™t be able to see it again).

    C. Add to .env.local:

3.  Google reCAPTCHA Keys
    Google reCAPTCHA helps prevent bots from accessing your website. Youâ€™ll need a site key and secret key to integrate reCAPTCHA into your application.

    Steps to Get Google reCAPTCHA Keys:

    A. Go to Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console:
    Visit Google reCAPTCHA and sign in with your Google account.

    B. Register a New Site:
    Click the + button in the top right to register a new site.
    Fill in the following details:
    Label: Enter a name like "Job Portal Website".
    reCAPTCHA Type: Choose reCAPTCHA v2 (most commonly used), or reCAPTCHA v3 if you don't want to show the reCAPTCHA checkbox.
    Domains: Enter the domain(s) where this will be used (e.g., localhost for development and your production domain for deployment).

    C. Get Site Key and Secret Key:
    After registering, youâ€™ll receive a Site Key and a Secret Key.

    D. Add to .env.local:
    Use the keys provided by Google:

To run the development server:

    npm run dev

    # or

    yarn dev

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the website.

Deployment

To deploy the project, use Vercel or any cloud provider that supports Next.js.
